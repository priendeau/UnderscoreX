Description: 
_XDecoratorWrapper.py

  DecoratorClass used to parse **Kargs and handle Warning and exception thru Missing Attribute by adding
  @_XDecoratorWrapper.Kargs2AttrPreException and creating a function having this decorator being called:
  @_XDecoratorWrapper.ObjectClassRaiser( ObjectAttributeHolder , ExceptionClass )


This structure is intended for The developper developping pass-thru and conviviable method to 
intercept attribut on demande by passing information from **kwargs or mutiple-string-chained argument.

=========
    This allow to build and easy model assuming you had readed the example. It offer a easy chaining method
    Thru decorator to parse incoming information from **kwargs or any multi-chained string. Once you have 
    defined a correct dictrionary of Attentend Attribute and Messages dedicated to inform the developper. 
    It contains a mechanism to push into warning or error the missing attribute informaitons. Rather to
    code individually all the missing attribute and condition, and exception class is provided as example.

Description: This structure is intended for The developper developping pass-thru and conviviable method to 
        intercept attribut on demande by passing information from **kwargs or mutiple-string-chained argument.
        
                ------------
            This allow to build and easy model assuming you had readed the example. It offer a easy chaining method
            Thru decorator to parse incoming information from **kwargs or any multi-chained string. Once you have 
            defined a correct dictrionary of Attentend Attribute and Messages dedicated to inform the developper. 
            It contains a mechanism to push into warning or error the missing attribute informaitons. Rather to
            code individually all the missing attribute and condition, and exception class is provided as example.

        Documentation
        =============
          Is currently lacking, about every method is documented in the source. But future prototype will
